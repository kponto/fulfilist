To get it going get postgres:

   brew install postgres

bundle that shit

    bundle
    
create the database:

    rake db:create


migrate!!!!

    rake db:migrate
    

Launch it:

    rails s


Make it pretty:

    kevin --work_it!
    
    
This is very much a work in progress. Probably some bugs, no tests, yadda yadda yadda... That is where you come in!
